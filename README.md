# ESPHome-Demo
This repo contains the configuration files for an ESPHome setup that I discuss in [a post](https://raincoatmoon.com/blog/esp-home-experience/) in my blog. More information in the link before. 

There are a few samples of files containing secrets. They have to be renamed by removing the `.example` extension and populated with the right data. Enjoy!
